# Xliff Tool
Xliff Tool is an app to helping your deal with Xliff files. Especially for Xliff 1.2 that Xcode exported. 

## Design Purpose
When developing apps with Xcode for multiple targets, say supporting iOS, watchOS and macOS in one project, there are a lot of pains on translations. You have to provide translations for each platform though most of them are the same. 

After some days, if your add new functions to your app, you have to find the untranslated words and translate them again.

Xliff Tool makes you do your job a lot easier. 

1. Xliff Tool automatically translates words on the other platforms when you translate on one platform. 
2. Xliff Tool asks you to verify those automatically translated words. 
3. Xliff Tool can save results to xliff file so you can import it to Xcode.
4. You can choose to skip verified results and even translated results so only the untranslated words are listed.
